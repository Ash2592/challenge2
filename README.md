Challenge2

The motivation behind this challenge was to build a portfoilo that I can use for the future.

I built this project to help showcase my work to future employers and to apply what I have learned within the last few weeks.

I learned how to build my own portfolio from scratch! I learned how to utilize the padding and margins. I learned how to add clickable links which was exciting once I got it down.
